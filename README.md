## 🎯 Course Objectives

This course offers a rigorous yet accessible introduction to the use of statistical and machine learning techniques in astronomy. From foundational concepts to advanced data-driven methodologies, students will explore how modern astronomical research increasingly relies on tools from statistics, artificial intelligence, and data science.

Through a blend of theoretical derivations and practical coding exercises, participants will gain firsthand experience with methods that underpin contemporary astrophysical discovery. While examples are primarily drawn from astronomy, the course content is broadly applicable to students in Physics and related fields who seek to deepen their understanding of data-driven inference.
